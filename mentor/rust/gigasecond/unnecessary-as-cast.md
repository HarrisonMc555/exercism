Excellent work! This is pretty much exactly how I would do it, too.

The only thing I would point out is that you don't need the "`as i64`". In Rust, numeric literals will be whatever the function requires (in this case, an `i64`).

However, this solution is totally fine as it is. Good luck with future exercises!
