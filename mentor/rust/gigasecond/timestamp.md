Great solution! Good job figuring out how to use an external library.

As it turns out, you don't actually need to convert to and from a timestampâ€”the `chrono` library provides a way to increment a `DateTime` by a `Duration`, which can be however long you want it to be (see [this][`DateTime::Add`]).

How about you try figuring how to use that functionality? If you have any questions (like how the `Add` trait works) feel free to reach out!
