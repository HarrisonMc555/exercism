This looks great! Nice job figuring out how to use an external library.

I see that you're using a `const` that is an `i32`. However, since `Duration::seconds` takes a `i64`, you're converting it to that.

Since you're the one who's defining the `const`ant, how about you define it as a `i64`? That way you can avoid extra conversions (i.e. `i64::from`). This reduces extra code that distracts from the purpose.

Do you want to try to do that before moving on? Other than that your solution looks great!
