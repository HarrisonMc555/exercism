This looks great! This is not the easiest exercise, nice job getting a working solution.

One thing I noticed is that you have some relatively complicated logic in your `Clock::new` function. I think it may be worth extracting some of that logic out into a separate function.

Do you want to try that before moving on? Let me know if you have any questions!
