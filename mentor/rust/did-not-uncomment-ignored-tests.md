At exercism, we encourage "test-driven development" (TDD). This process entails writing just enough code to make the first test pass, running the next test(s) until one fails, writing just enough code to make the new test pass, and repeating. As part of that process, the included test file ignores all tests but the first one. Once you get that one to work, you then need to manually delete the `#[ignored]` directive for the next test to run it. Once you've deleted all `#[ignored]` directives, then you've completed the exercise! You should also see "`0 ignored`" in the output of `cargo test`.
