This is great! Excellent use of iterators, `collect`, etc.

I just have one suggestion: for your next solution, try out [implicit return statements]! They're considered idiomatic Rust and help reduce redundancy.

Great job! Looking forward to your next solution!

P.S. If you're interested in learning more about how complex strings can be, you can run the "bonus" test case with `cargo test --all-features`. Feel free to move on and come back though.
