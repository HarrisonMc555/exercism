This is great! Excellent use of iterators, implicit returns, `collect`, etc. Also, nice work using the `unicode_segmentation` crate.

Before you move on, I just want to point out two things.

If you look at the definition of the [`graphemes`] method, you'll notice that the first argument is `&self` (we can ignore the `'a`, it's irrelevant to this discussion). This means that we can call this function with "method" syntax, like so:

```rust
my_string.graphemes(is_extended)
```

This is typically preferred over the "fully-qualified" syntax:

```rust
UnicodeSegmentation::graphemes(my_string, is_extended)
```

My only other tip would be to remove the temporary variable. Occasionally I'll find it useful to give a value a name even though I'll be returning it immediately. However, in this case, I don't think it's more readable than simply returning the valueâ€”it may be less readable. Considering this function is so short, it would be considered idiomatic to simply us an [implicit return statement] for the entire expression. It would look something like this:

```rust
pub fn reverse(input: &str) -> String {
    input.graphemes(true).rev().collect()
}
```

It's not a big deal, but I think you'll find that it helps make your code easier to read!

Good luck with the next exercise! Let me know if you have any questions.
