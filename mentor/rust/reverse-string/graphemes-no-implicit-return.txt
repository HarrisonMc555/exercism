This is great! Excellent use of iterators, `collect`, etc. Also, nice work using the `unicode_segmentation` crate. Good luck with the next exercise!

I just have one suggestion before moving on: try out [implicit return statements]! They're considered idiomatic Rust and help reduce redundancy.

Great job! Looking forward to your next iteration!
