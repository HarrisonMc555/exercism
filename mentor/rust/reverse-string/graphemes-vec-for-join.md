This is great! Very nice use of the `unicode_segmentation` crate. This solution shows that you've mastered several Rust concepts.

One thing to keep in mind is that every time you call `collect` you are allocating and creating an entirely new data structure. In this case, you are creating a `Vec<&str>`. However, you don't actually need this `Vec`â€”in the end, you want a `String`.

Sometimes, allocating temporary data structures is necessary for certain algorithms or optimizations. However, in many situations, you can avoid these intermediary structures.

In this case, the only thing you use the `Vec` for is to call `join`. However, the `collect` method can produce almost any kind of "collection"â€”`Vec`, `HashSet`, and even `String`! If you just call `collect` when the output is a `String` it will make a `String` from the iterator.

Try using that and see how it affects your solution! Looking forward to your next iteration ðŸ˜Š
