This is great! Excellent use of iterators, `collect`, etc. Also, nice work using the `unicode_segmentation` crate.

I just have one suggestion for the next exercise: try out [implicit return statements]! They're considered idiomatic Rust and help reduce redundancy.

Great job! Good luck with the next exercise!
