This looks great! Very nicely done. Good luck with future exercises 😊

P.S. If you're interested in learning more about how complex strings can be, you can run the "bonus" test case with `cargo test --all-features`. Feel free to move on and come back though. You may want to look into the [`unicode-segementation`] crate if you do.
